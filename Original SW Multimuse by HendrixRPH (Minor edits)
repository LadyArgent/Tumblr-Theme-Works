    Hey friends! I'm HendrixRPH and this is my first character page theme. Don't claim this as your own, don't remove the credit, and don't use as a base, please!
    
    On the other hand, if you want to steal the code that lets you filter by multiple criteria, go ahead. I stole it from the Isotope documentation anyway. I would recommend you look at it yourself before using so that you get the HTML structure right. Here is where I got it from: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/filtering.html#combination-filters
    
    That said, special thanks to Metafizzy for this awesome library!

Okay, changing the filters is potentially the most difficult part. I'll try to explain how you do it.

*** ADD A NEW OPTION TO AN EXISTING GROUP:

    Let's say you want to stick to my defaults, but want to add a "ghost" option for species. Go down to the button group you want to add an option to, in this case species. It looks like this: 
    
    --
    
    <h2>Species</h2>
    <div class="button-group" data-filter-group="species">
        <button data-filter="" class="button ischecked">any</button>
        <button data-filter=".human" class="button">human</button>
        <button data-filter=".werewolf" class="button">werewolf</button>
        <button data-filter=".vampire" class="button">vampire</button>
    </div>
    
    --
    
    To add an option, start by copying one of the buttons and pasting it on the line below. We'll copy the vampire one. Here's what it looks like now.
    
    --
    
    <h2>Species</h2>
    <div class="button-group" data-filter-group="species">
        <button data-filter="" class="button ischecked">any</button>
        <button data-filter=".human" class="button">human</button>
        <button data-filter=".werewolf" class="button">werewolf</button>
        <button data-filter=".vampire" class="button">vampire</button>
        <button data-filter=".vampire" class="button">vampire</button>
    </div>
    
    --
    
    But we don't want two vampire ones, so we'll change the values. Here's what it will look like after the values are changed, compared to the original:
    
    --
    
    Original: <button data-filter=".vampire" class="button">vampire</button>
    New version: <button data-filter=".ghost" class="button">ghost</button>
    --
    
    And that's it! Everything should work. 
    
    
*** REMOVE AN OPTION FROM AN EXISTING GROUP

    This one's simple. Just find the code for the button that you want to remove and delete that one line. You're done!
    

*** ADD A NEW FILTER GROUP

    For this example, we'll pretend you want to add a filter group for the character's grade (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). First, copy and paste any of the filter groups, starting at the <h2> tag and ending at the </div>. Here's what we'll start with:
    
    --
    
    <h2>Species</h2>
        <div class="button-group" data-filter-group="species">
            <button data-filter="" class="button ischecked">any</button>
            <button data-filter=".human" class="button">human</button>
            <button data-filter=".werewolf" class="button">werewolf</button>
            <button data-filter=".vampire" class="button">vampire</button>
        </div>
    
    --
    
    Change the text between the <h2> tags to the title of your filter, in this case "Grade."
    
    Next, we need to give the filter group a new official name. In the div tag, the one that looks like this:
    
        <div class="button-group" data-filter-group="species">
    
    Replace the content of data-filter-group="___" with whatever you want to call your group. In this case, grade works.
    
    Don't mess with the first button! Having an "any" button is important, we don't want to remove it. If you really want to call it something else youc an change the "any" text to something else like "all", but leave all the attributes within the tag the same.
    
    Now modify the other buttons to create your new options. You'll need to change the data-filter attribute (keep the period at the beginning, that's crucial!) and the label that's between the <button></button> tags. 
    
    For the data-filter, do not have any spaces. If you have multiple words, seperate them by dashes. Add and remove options as necessary. 
    
    In the end, it should look like this:
    
    --
    
    <h2>Grade</h2>
        <div class="button-group" data-filter-group="grade">
            <button data-filter="" class="button ischecked">any</button>
            <button data-filter=".freshman" class="button">freshman</button>
            <button data-filter=".sophomore" class="button">sophomore</button>
            <button data-filter=".junior" class="button">junior</button>
            <button data-filter=".senior" class="button">senior</button>
        </div>
    
    --
    
    And you're done! Make sure you add the new data filters to the class section of your character entries so the sorting will work. How to do that is covered further down.
    

*** REMOVE A FILTER GROUP

    To remove a filter group, locate the one you want to remove in the code. Delete everything starting from the <h2> tag and ending at the </div> tag.
        
        -->
        
        <div class="filters">
            <h2>Status</h2>
            <div class="button-group" data-filter-group="status">
                <button data-filter="" class="button ischecked">All</button>
                <button data-filter=".main" class="button">Main</button>
                <button data-filter=".secondary" class="button">Secondary</button>
                <button data-filter=".request" class="button">Request</button>
            </div>
            
        <h2>Affiliation</h2>
        <div class="button-group" data-filter-group="affiliation">
            <button data-filter="" class="button ischecked">Any</button>
               <button data-filter=".clone" class="button">Clone</button>
               <button data-filter=".jedi" class="button">Jedi</button>
               <button data-filter=".sith" class="button">Sith</button>

                <p>Born on Tepasi to a well-connected, if subtly so, family, Annubin (Nubin to his friends) quickly decided life serving his family's gains was not his fate. Joining the Tepasi Intelligence Network at the age of 18, he spent nearly twelve years doing undercover jobs on-planet and off, and another eight years training new spies. By the age of 43 he had amassed enough clout within the government to find supporters for his run for Senate, and was elected by a landslide.</p>
                <p>Nubin serves the interests of his people before anything else, and so worked with Bail Organa and Padme Amidala (among others) to oppose Chancellor Palpatine's orders, the Clone Wars in general, and the treatment of the clones themselves. During the Galactic Civil War, he aided the Rebellion until the dismantling of the Imperial Senate, whereupon he took up arms against the Empire. After the reformation of the Republic, he was once again elected to the Senate, where he helped the Alliance wherever possible.

                <p>A Hutt Agen Kolar has met on several occasions, Aruk runs a fairly legitimate business on Nar Shaddaa; his cantinas and shops are generally as above-board as it can get on the moon, and if not safe, are at least unbiased in their suspicions of patrons (Jedi included). He’s been around the block long enough to know that pissing off Jedi isn’t a good business practice…and he likes to keep his relations with them as positive as he can, even to the detriment of his familial relations.</p>

                <p>Bant Eerin was a Mon Calamari Jedi Healer during the years leading up to the Clone Wars.  She was a close friend of Siri Tachi and Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Her gentle, even-keeled nature saw her through quite a few crises, and her skill as a fighter saw her safely out of a few more.  Although widely believed to have been killed during the Jedi Purge of Order 66 at the end of the CLone Wars, Bant escaped the Temple and out into the Outer Rim, where she plied her services as a Healer for the betterment of communities there.</p>

                <p>Originally slated for a command position, Cad’s eventual knack for the bare minimum medicine training given slotted him in for further training, until eventually he was made a medic. Early on he discovered Cody had a knack for getting into trouble and getting hurt, and eventually Cad made it his personal mission to make sure his young commander came back from an exercise in as good a shape as possible. Eventually this extended to Obi-Wan as well.</p>
                <p>Cad is gruff, no-nonsense, and eternally exasperated with his commanders, but he puts up with them out of genuine care. He’s one of the better medics in the GAR, which is quite fortunate for one Jedi and one Clone Marshal.</p>

                <p>Born to Jocasta Nu and and Knight Dooku in the year (btwn 67 and 72 BBY), Calista was a mistake gone right. Her first concrete memories are of her family on Serenno, and spending long hours with her parents.</p>
                <p>Strongly connected to the Living Force, Calista always had a knack for dealing with animals, and eventually with understanding her fellow humanoids, although in her early years she avoided most people. Gifted with her father's training and her mother's practicality, the girl became a decent fighter with lightsaber and blaster, although she leaned more towards the lightsaber in skill. Eventually, as she grew older, her dislike for humanoids faded, and her father's silver tongue made itself apparent in her demeanor.
                <br>By the time Calista was twenty-five years old, she had become an official diplomat for the planet of Serenno, and had been offered the job of an aide to the Senator. She chose the former, and worked to advance the interests of the planet in the galactic community, with words where possible, and force where necessary.

                <p>Rescued from a pirate vessel in her early years by Mace Windu, Depa Billaba was a studious, dedicated Jedi youngling, interested more in diplomacy than in her lightsaber. As she came of age to be selected as a padawan, it was her rescuer who took her on, and treated her more as a daughter than an apprentice. Taught the highly risky version of Form VII that Windu and Sora Bulq created, Vaapad, Depa eventually came to surpass Windu's swrdsmanship, though she prided herself on using words before all else.</p>
                <p>With the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Depa was sent to Windu's homeplanet of Haruun Kaal, where she committed and saw horrors enough to drive her mad. She carved out the symbol of Great Enlightenment she had attained on her homeworld in her shame, and nearly killed her old Master when he came to fetch her. Dropping into a coma from her injuries, after awking she was put on trial for war crimes, and found innocent due to extenuating circumstances. It was at this point she took on a young Caleb Dume as her apprentice, a youngling she ahd watched grow and taken an interest in.</p>

By the time Depa brought her padawan back with her, they had mostly recovered their losses...of his command crew, only three survived. But it was better than nothing.

                <p>Master Tholme was a human Jedi Master who specialized in the healing arts of the Force. During his time as a Knight, he trained on the planet Anzat to enhance his anturally powerful skills, which dealt mainly in subterfuge and manipulation, where he honed a particular talent for death trances and masking his presence in the Force. Shortly after his reaching the rank of Master, he was made the system protector of the planet Kiffu. It was here he met his future padawan, Quinlan Vos, through his friendship with the then-current Sheyf, Quinlan's great-uncle.</p>
                <p>After the death of Quinlan's parents, and the subsequent trauma suffered by his padawan, Tholme took the boy to the Temple to train. During this time they fought in the Stark Hyperspace War, investigating the mysterious bacta shortage that preceded it and eventually fighting in the war themselves.</p>
                <p>Serving as the Council's spymaster due to his particularly strong talent for masking his Force signature, Tholme was sent undercover to watch his former padawan when he was sent to Kiffex, to judge whether or not he was prone to Falling after losing his memories. During this mission, he helped to rescue his new student, Aayla Secura, Quinlan's former padawan.
                <br>During the Clone Wars, Tholme lost a leg and an eye to Count Dooku, but survived their duel, replacing both with prosthetics and continuing to serve the Jedi. He survived Order 66, and lived with his lover T'ra Sa on the planet Kahyyk, until his death. His funeral pyre was held on the planet Anzat.

                <p>Wullf Yularen started life with a silver spoon. Son of a prominent Coruscanti family, his choice to join the Navy was, in many circles, seen as a disgrace. The youth's insistence on being treated like a normal recruit and not taking advantage of his position, earned him the scorn of many of the established Core World families.
                <p>After several tours through the Outer Rim, and nearly a decade spent as an intelligence officer in the Sneatorial Guard, and the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Yularen was named to the rank of admiral, and served under Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. While fond of his commander, and the clones who made up the bulk of his crew, he found his general too reckless for his liking. During the War he served with competent, quiet stability to offset his general's more boisterous nature...
                <p>With the formation of the Empire, and the significant changes that followed, Yularen resigned his position in the Navy, and joined the Imperial Security Bureau. He rose quickly through the ranks there as well, eventually landing himself as the second-highest ranking officer within the internal security branch.
